#summary Downloading and installing RubyCAS-Server

== The Easy Way ==

If you already have a Ruby package installed, you should be able to install RubyCAS-Server by running the following command:

{{{
gem install rubycas-server
}}}

A number of dependencies will be installed, and you should be good to go. Head over to the QuickStart and HowToConfigure wiki pages for further info. However if the above doesn't work for you, read on for detailed installation instructions.

== The Hard Way ==

You can download the RubyCAS-Server !RubyGem package or source code directly from the *[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3127&release_id=20723 RubyCAS-Server RubyForge downloads page]*. However, the preferred method is to install via the central *!RubyGems* repository, since this will automatically grab the required dependencies for you.

=== Installing via !RubyGems ===

  # Make sure that you have a [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby] interpreter installed. Version 1.8.6 or later is recommended. If you're on Windows, the quick and easy way to install Ruby is the [http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/27227/ruby186-26_rc2.exe One-Click Installer].
  # You will also need the !RubyGems package management system. Generally this is automatically installed for you along with the Ruby interpreter. To see if you have !RubyGems installed, open up a command prompt and type `gem`. If that doesn't work, you will need to [http://rubygems.org/read/chapter/3 install it manually].
  # Once !RubyGems is installed, you should be able to install RubyCAS-Server by running the command: {{{gem install rubycas-server}}}
  # Answer 'Yes' when asked about installing dependencies.


RubyCAS-Server should now be installed. Try running `rubycas-server` from your command line. By default RubyCAS-Server is pre-configured for operation on Linux. The program has to be able to write some configuration files to `/etc` and its log to `/var/log/casserver.log`, so you will have to run the `rubycas-server` command as root (i.e. `sudo rubycas-server`). If you prefer to store your configuration files elsewhere, try running `rubycas-server` with the `-h` flag for a list of command-line options. If you are running on Windows, you will have to translate some of this Linux jargon into appropriate equivalents for your system.

The first time you run RubyCAS-Server, the server will try to create a default configuration file for you in `/etc/rubycas-server/config.yml` and will then exit. Have a look inside this file and edit it to your needs. RubyCAS-Server requires a SQL database; configuration examples are provided for various database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.). Before running the `rubycas-server` command again, make sure that the database you've configured is ready to be used. For example, if you're using mysql, you'll have to create the database first:

{{{mysqladmin -u root -p create rubycas}}}

Once you've configured everything and granted access to the database, run `rubycas-server` again. The server should start up this time and run in the foreground.

You can also use `rubycas-server-ctl start` to start the server in the background. See the QuickStart and HowToConfigure wiki pages for further info.

=== Installing Manually ===

The !RubyGem method describe above is preferred, but if you insist...

  # Make sure you have a [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby] interpreter installed. Version 1.8.6 or later is recommended.
  # Download the dependencies. You will need (at least):
    * [http://rubyforge.org/projects/activesupport ActiveSupport]
    * [http://rubyforge.org/projects/activerecord ActiveRecord]
    * [http://rubyforge.org/projects/picnic Picnic]
  # Install the dependencies as per their individual install instructions. If for some insane reason you're trying to avoid !RubyGems, the general procedure is to install the libraries somewhere in Ruby's include path (for example `/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8` on some Linux systems).
  # Download the RubyCAS-Server source archive from [http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3127&release_id=20723 RubyCAS-Server RubyForge downloads page]. 
   * Alternatively, you may want to grab the development source code from the [http://github.com/gunark/rubycas-server/tree/master Github Repo]
  # Untar the source archive and `cd` into the uncompressed directory.
  # Run {{{ruby setup.rb}}}.

RubyCAS-Server should now be installed. See the QuickStart and HowToConfigure wiki pages further instructions.

=== Obtaining the Source Code ===

RubyCAS-Server is written in a interpreted language (Ruby), so there really isn't a difference between the runable distribution and the "source code" (i.e. the RubyGem and tar packages include all of the source code).

However, if you want to grab a copy of the latest development source code, have a look at RubyCAS-Server's [http://github.com/gunark/rubycas-server/tree/master Github repository], or the mirrored [http://code.google.com/p/ruby-taskr/source Subversion repo].
