#summary Instructions on how to deploy under Phusion Passenger (mod_rails/mod_rack)
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

As of version 0.8.0, RubyCAS-Server can be deployed under Apache using the Phusion Passenger module (also known as mod_rails/mod_rack).

No additional configuration is requried to run RubyCAS-Server under Passenger. Just follow the normal instructions for a Passenger app (see http://www.modrails.com/).

The `server` setting in your config file (and related settings) are ignored when running under Apache, since the port, location of the SSL certificate, etc. are all configured in your Apache vhost.conf.

== Example Apache vhost Config ==

Here's an example Apache vhost config for RubyCAS-Server and Passenger:

{{{
Listen 442
<VirtualHost *:442>
  ServerAdmin admin@example.net
  ServerName login.example.net

  SSLEngine On
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/example.pem

  RailsAutoDetect off

  DocumentRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rubycas-server-0.8.0/public

  <Directory "/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rubycas-server-0.8.0/public">
    AllowOverride all
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
}}}
