#summary Step-by-step installation and usage instructions
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

=Overview=

To set up a full CAS infrastructure you will have to:

  # *Install the CAS server for your organization* (i.e. install RubyCAS-Server, although other implementations exist, such as [http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/ JA-SIG CAS])
  # *Configure the CAS server's method for validating usernames and passwords.* Out of the, box RubyCAS-Server can authenticate against an LDAP directory, a SQL database, Microsoft's Active Directory, etc. It is also possible to write a custom authenticator with a [WritingCustomAuthenticators little bit of Ruby coding].
  # *Add CAS clients to your web applications.* CAS clients are available for most major web frameworks, including [http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/client/javaclient/ Java], [http://esup-phpcas.sourceforge.net PHP], and [http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubycas-client/ Ruby on Rails].

=Installation=

===Server Requirements===

  * [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby 1.8.4] or newer
  * [http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3 RubyGems]
  * Ruby bindings for your preferred database. MySQL will probably work out-of-the-box. For other databases like SQLite3 and PostgreSQL you may have to install additional Ruby libraries first (e.g. `gem install sqlite3-ruby` for SQLite3).
  * An SSL certificate (CAS requires SSL)
  * A Unix-like OS such as Linux or Mac OS X (RubyCAS-Server should work on other platforms, but the instructions here are POSIX-specific)

===Installation & Usage===

_*TO DO: WRITE INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW SINATRA-BASED SERVER*_

In the meantime: 

 * RubyCAS-Server is now a Rack-based Sinatra app. Googling for general instructions on deploying a Sinatra app should get you most of the way there. 
 * Install Bundler and run `bundle install --without development` from the rubycas-server installation directory to install dependencies. _(FIXME: does the --without switch actually work?)_
 * You'll need to copy the example config file under [https://github.com/gunark/rubycas-server/blob/master/resources/config.example.yml resources/config.example.yml] to `/etc/rubycas-server/config.yml` (there are ways to put this file elsewhere, but this is yet to be documented).
 * Run `rake db:migrate` to generate the necessary database schema (db config is in your config.yml file).

.....

You should now be up and running. Depending on the settings you entered in your config.yml file (i.e. port, hostname, etc.), the server should now be available at https://localhost  (or some variation thereof).

More detailed configuration information is available at HowToConfigure and UsageScenarios, but if you prefer to jump right in, you should be able to figure things out based on the comments in the sample config.


*If you encounter any bugs or issues with RubyCAS-Server, please do not hesitate to [http://github.com/gunark/rubycas-server/issues open an issue ticket]!*

You can also ask for help via the [http://groups.google.com/group/rubycas-server RubyCAS Google Group].
