#summary How-to guide for contributing translations to RubyCAS-Server's localization files.

This section is yet to be written, however here are some general guidelines:

  * Localization is handled by the [http://www.yotabanana.com/hiki/ruby-gettext.html?ruby-gettext Ruby-GetText] library
  * Translations are stored under the [http://github.com/gunark/rubycas-server/tree/master/po po] directory.
  * You can edit translations (or create new ones) using a text-editor (for example `vim`):
    # Put your .po file under the appropriate sub-directory (e.g.: `po/eo_AQ/rubycas-server.po` for the Esperanto language, for the Antarctica region). It's best to use an existing .po file as a template (look at `po/es_ES/rubycas-server.po` for example).
    # When you're done editing your .po file, `cd` back to the root rubycas-server directory and run `rake mo`. This will generate the binary .mo file under the `locale` directory.
    # Run the server as normal.

The user's preferred language should be automatically detected based on their browser's settings, but if you want to set a default language (normally it's English), change the 'default_locale' value in your [HowToConfigure config.yml] file.

To contribute your translations/corrections, please email your .po file to *matt at roughest dot net*.
