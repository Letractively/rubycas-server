=== 0.5.0 :: In Progress

* Gateway requests should now be handled correctly. Note that if you are using
  RubyCAS-Client and want gatewaying, you will need to upgrade it to 1.1.0 as 
  gatewaying was broken in prior versions.

=== 0.4.2 :: 2007-07-26

* The LDAP/AD authenticator has been largely re-written. The code is a bit
  cleaner now, and should work better with non-Active Directory LDAP servers
  (although this has yet to be tested since I don't have access to a non-AD
  LDAP server).
* The validate() method in your authenticators now receives a :service element
  (in addition to :username, and :password). This is simply the service
  url (if any) specified in the user's CAS request. If you call 
  read_standard_credentials(credentials) at the top of your validator, the value
  will also be available as @service along with @username and @password.
* By request, a :username_prefix option has been added to the ldap 
  configuration. If entered, this string will be automatically prefixed to 
  the username entered by the user.
* A bug having to do with handling authenticator errors has been fixed.
  Any authenticator error messages should now be correctly shown on the
  login page.
* Minor improvements to error messages having to do with login tickets.
  They're a bit more prescriptive now, explaining to the user what steps
  they should take to correct the error.

=== 0.4.1 :: 2007-06-07

* This release restores compatiblity with older versions of rubygems
  (pre-0.9.0). To achieve this, we alias the 'gem' method to the old 
  'require_gem' if 'gem' is not already defined.
* rubycas-server-ctl will now quiety delete an orphaned .pid file 
  instead complaining loudly and refusing to start up.
* Fixed minor bug in rubycas-server-ctl that sometimes incorrectly reported
  startup problems when in fact the server had started just fine.


=== 0.4.0 :: 2007-06-05

* Added rubycas-server-ctl script for controlling daemonized server.
* rubygems-0.9.0 or later is now required.
* Added system startup script to be used in /etc/init.d on Linux systems.
* Authenticator can now be loaded from an external file using the 'source'
  configuration option.
* Better preemptive detection of startup problems with mongrel.
* User now sees an error message if the service URI is not a valid URI (i.e.
  if it's not URI-encoded or otherwise malformed).


=== 0.3.0 :: 2007-03-29

* Fixed glaring security problem with LDAP/AD Authenticator where under some
  circumstances blank passwords were accepted as valid.
* Autocomplete has been turned off on the password field for better security.
  In the future we may allow autocomplete to be re-enabled using a
  configuration setting.
* When the user visits the login page and is already authenticated (i.e. they
  have a valid ticket granting cookie), a message is shown at the top 
  indicating that they are already logged in.
* sqlite3-ruby is no longer required by the gem as a dependency.  The user 
  must now install it manually prior to installing rubycas-server. The
  building of sqlite3 native extensions appears to be somewhat flakey
  and probably defeats the original purpose of using it (which was
  to have a CAS server up and running with no additional DB configuration).
  We will use MySQL as the default database adapter instead, since it does
  not require additional libraries and many users will have a MySQL server
  already available.
* Fixed bug that was causing all proxy-granting tickets to be deleted whenever
  any user logged out. Only the PGTs for the user that is logging out are now
  being deleted.
* Trailing slashes in service URLs are now ignored when validating service
  and proxy tickets (e.g. "http://www.google.com" and "http://www.google.com/"
  are now considered to be the same service URL).
* Authenticators now raise AuthenticatorError exceptions when encountering
  a problem/error. This makes it easier to send feedback to the user.
  However, other exceptions should still be raised when errors ought
  not be recoverable (i.e. programming errors).
* Fixed serious vulnerability in LDAP authenticator where under some
  cirumstances the user could just enter '*' as their username to match 
  any username. The LDAP authenticator will now refuse to process logins 
  with usernames that contain the characters * ( ) \ / and the NULL 
  character \0.
* Views are no longer xhtml-validated. Markaby's auto-validation was turned
  off to allow for use of the autocomplete property on inputs, since this is
  the only viable way of turning off password storage in IE and Firefox at
  the page level.
* You can now limit the maximum length of a login session by setting the
  expire_sessions config setting to true.
* Fixed some minor bugs in the login view.


=== 0.2.0 :: 2007-03-20

* ruby-casserver now behaves more like a real command-line app, accepting
  various command line arguments including -h (help), -v (version), -c (use
  an alternate config.yml), and -d (daemonize, when using webrick or mongrel 
  mode).
* Special characters in CAS XML responses are now properly encoded into XML
  entities
* CAS XML responses are no longer auto-indented... Markaby's indentation
  seemed to be causing problems with the PHP CAS client.
* Misc minor bug fixes/cleanup.


=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-03-01

* First public release.
