=Localization (l10n) in RubyCAS-Server=

Localization in RubyCAS-Server is implemented through Ruby-GetText.

Currently the following localizations are available:

  * Geman (de_DE)
  * Spanish (es_ES)
  * French (fr_FR)
  * Japanese (ja_JP)
  * Polish (pl_PL)
  * Russian (ru_RU)

These translations should work out of the box if you install RubyCAS-Server as a gem; otherwise you may have to build he locale .mo files by running the `rake mo` command in the RubyCAS-Server installation directory.

The server should auto-detect the user's preferred language based on
headers submitted by their browser. You can force a certain language
to be used by adding a 'lang' parameter to the CAS URL (for example,
'&lang=de' for german). You can also change the default language from
english to something else using the 'default_locale' option in your
config.yml file.

Most of the included localizations are machine translated, so the
quality of the translation probably isn't very good. 

If you would like to submit corrections or additional translations please see:

Thanks to Antono Vasiljev for implementing much of the localization code in RubyCAS-Server!
