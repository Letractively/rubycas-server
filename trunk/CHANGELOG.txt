=== 0.3.0 :: in progress

* sqlite3-ruby is no longer required by the gem as a dependency.  The user 
  must now install it manually prior to installing rubycas-server. The
  building of sqlite3 native extensions appears to be somewhat flakey
  and probably defeats the original purpose of using sqlite3 (which was
  to have a CAS server up and running with no additional DB configuration).
* Authenticators now raise AuthenticatorError exceptions when encountering
  a problem/error. This makes it easier to send feedback to the user.
  However, other exceptions should still be raised when errors ought
  not be recoverable (i.e. programming errors).
* Trailing slashes in service URLs are now ignored when validating service
  and proxy tickets (e.g. "http://www.google.com" and "http://www.google.com/"
  are now considered to be the same service URL).
* Fixed serious vulnerability in LDAP authenticator where under some
  cirumstances the user could just enter '*' as their username to match 
  any username. The LDAP authenticator will now refuse to process logins 
  with usernames that contain the characters * ( ) \ / and the NULL 
  character \0.
* Fixed some minor bugs in the login view.


=== 0.2.0 :: 2007-03-20

* ruby-casserver now behaves more like a real command-line app, accepting
  various command line arguments including -h (help), -v (version), -c (use
  an alternate config.yml), and -d (daemonize, when using webrick or mongrel 
  mode).
* Special characters in CAS XML responses are now properly encoded into XML
  entities
* CAS XML responses are no longer auto-indented... Markaby's indentation
  seemed to be causing problems with the PHP CAS client.
* Misc minor bug fixes/cleanup.

=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-03-01

* First public release.
