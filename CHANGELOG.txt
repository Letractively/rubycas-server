=== 0.2.0 :: 

* ruby-casserver now behaves more like a real command-line app, accepting
  various command line arguments including -h (help), -v (version), -c (use
  an alternate config.yml), and -d (daemonize, when using webrick or mongrel mode)
* special characters in CAS XML responses are now properly encoded into XML
  entities
* CAS XML responses are no longer auto-indented... Markaby's indentation
  seemed to be causing problems with the PHP CAS client
* Misc minor bug fixes/cleanup

* First public release.
